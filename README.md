## Q&A

**I Googled what's on this mug, but I have no idea what it means**

Have you thought about the choices in your life that have led you to Google a mug? Anyway, this mug is a beautiful piece of art made by [Spatie](https://spatie.be). We build web applications, courses & open source packages for Laravel.

**I like the cup, but I can't really wear it in a way that allows me to go outside. Do you have a solution for this?**

Uuuuuuuh. Sure. You can find a shirt that fits your criteria on [our merch store](https://spatie.myspreadshop.net/men?q=D1). Please don't wear mugs ever.
